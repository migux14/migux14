👋 Hi, I’m @migux14 (on twitter) but in real life I'm just Miguel from Brazil 🙃.
I’m interested in Data Science 🧐,
I’m currently learning statistic at National School of Statistical Sciences (ENCE) 📈,
I’m looking to collaborate on The R project®,

Here are some projects that I have been developing throughout my undergraduate studies in Statistics!

I hope you enjoy! 😄👍
